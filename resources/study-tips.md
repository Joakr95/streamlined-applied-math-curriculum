## 🧠 Learning Techniques

### Active Recall
**What:** Test yourself instead of re-reading
**How:**
- Close the book and write what you remember
- Do practice problems without looking at solutions
- Explain concepts out loud to yourself
- Use flashcards for formulas and definitions

**Why it works:** Forces your brain to retrieve information, strengthening neural pathways.

---

### Spaced Repetition
**What:** Review material at increasing intervals
**How:**
- Day 1: Learn new concept
- Day 2: Quick review
- Day 7: Review again
- Day 14: Review again
- Day 30: Final review

**Why it works:** Prevents forgetting and moves knowledge to long-term memory.

---

### Feynman Technique
**What:** Teach to learn
**How:**
1. Pick a concept
2. Explain it in simple terms (as if teaching a child)
3. Identify gaps in your understanding
4. Review and simplify further

**Why it works:** Teaching forces deep understanding, reveals misconceptions.

---

### Pomodoro Technique
**What:** Time-boxed focused work
**How:**
- 25 min focused work
- 5 min break
- Repeat 4 times
- Take 15-30 min longer break

**Why it works:** Maintains focus, prevents burnout, improves retention.

## 💪 Problem-Solving Strategies

### When Stuck on a Problem

**5-Minute Rule:** Try for 5 minutes before looking for help

**30-Minute Rule:** After 30 minutes, seek hints (not solutions)

**Strategies to try:**
1. **Reread the problem** - Are you solving the right thing?
2. **Draw a picture** - Visualize the problem
3. **Try a simpler version** - Reduce complexity
4. **Work backwards** - Start from desired answer
5. **Look for patterns** - Similar problems you've solved?
6. **Break it down** - Solve in smaller steps
7. **Check units/dimensions** - Does your answer make sense?
8. **Use examples** - Try specific numbers first

---

### Productive Struggle vs. Spinning Wheels

**Productive struggle (keep going):**
- You're making incremental progress
- You understand the concepts, just working through application
- You're learning from mistakes
- Time feels productive

**Spinning wheels (seek help):**
- No progress after 30+ minutes
- Don't understand fundamental concepts
- Same mistakes repeatedly
- Frustration overwhelming learning

---

## 🎯 Focus & Productivity

### Environment Setup
**Ideal study space:**
- ✅ Quiet (or use noise-cancelling headphones)
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ Comfortable but not too comfortable
- ✅ All materials ready
- ✅ Phone in another room
- ✅ Internet blockers active (if needed)

---

### Eliminate Distractions

**Digital:**
- Use Freedom, Cold Turkey, or similar
- Block: social media, news, YouTube (non-educational)
- Use website blockers during study times

**Physical:**
- Study alone initially
- Tell others not to disturb you
- Use "do not disturb" signs
- Remove tempting objects from desk

**Mental:**
- Keep a "worry list" - write down intrusive thoughts to address later
- Start with easiest task (build momentum)
- Set specific goals for each session

---

## 📅 Time Management

### Weekly Planning Template
```
Sunday: Plan week, review progress
Monday: 3 hrs new material
Tuesday: 2 hrs problem sets
Wednesday: 3 hrs new material
Thursday: 2 hrs problem sets
Friday: 3 hrs projects
Saturday: 4 hrs review + hard problems
Sunday: 3 hrs projects + planning

Total: 20 hrs
```

**Flexibility:** Adjust based on your schedule, but keep consistent times.

---

### Don't Break the Chain
- Mark calendar with X for each study day
- Goal: Long chain of X's
- Missing one day OK, but never two in a row
- Visual progress is motivating

---

### Time Blocking
**Example day:**
```
6:00-7:00   Morning routine
7:00-8:30   Study Block 1
8:30-9:00   Breakfast
9:00-12:00  Work
12:00-1:00  Lunch
1:00-5:00   Work
5:00-5:30   Break
5:30-7:30   Study Block 2
7:30-9:00   Dinner + relax
9:00-10:00  Light review
10:00       Sleep
```

**Key:** Schedule study blocks when your energy is highest.

## 🤝 Study Groups

### Benefits
- Accountability
- Different perspectives
- Teaching others solidifies learning
- Social motivation
- Catch mistakes

### How to Run Effective Study Groups

**Before meeting:**
- Everyone does homework individually
- Set clear agenda
- Choose time limit (2-3 hours max)

**During meeting:**
- Review hardest problems together
- Each person explains one solution
- Identify common misconceptions
- Work on practice problems

**After meeting:**
- Individual review of confusing topics
- Follow-up on open questions

**Red flags (unproductive groups):**
- One person does all the work
- Too much socializing, little studying
- Copying answers without understanding
- No preparation before meetings

---

## 🔄 Review Strategies

### End of Day Review (10 min)
- What did I learn today?
- What was confusing?
- What do I need to review?
- Quick look at tomorrow's material

### End of Week Review (30 min)
- Redo one hard problem from each topic
- Review notes
- Update progress tracker
- Plan next week

### End of Phase Review (2-4 hours)
- Complete practice exam (if available)
- Teach entire phase to someone
- Mind map of all connections
- Identify weak areas for later review

---

## 💻 Programming Efficiency

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Read error message** - Actually read it!
2. **Google the error** - You're not the first
3. **Print/debug** - Add print statements
4. **Simplify** - Comment out code until it works
5. **Ask for help** - Stack Overflow, Discord

### Good Coding Practices
- **Comment your code** - Future you will thank you
- **Use descriptive names** - `calculate_eigenvalues()` not `f()`
- **Test incrementally** - Don't write 100 lines then test
- **Version control** - Commit often to Git
- **Refactor** - Clean up working code

## 🧘 Mental Health & Burnout Prevention

### Warning Signs of Burnout
- Dreading study time
- Declining quality of work
- Physical fatigue
- Irritability
- Loss of motivation
- Sleep problems

### Prevention
**Weekly:**
- Take one full day off
- Physical exercise (3x/week minimum)
- Social interaction
- Hobbies unrelated to math

**Daily:**
- 7-8 hours sleep
- Regular meals
- Breaks between study sessions
- Outdoor time

**Monthly:**
- Complete week off after each phase
- Assess progress and adjust
- Celebrate wins

### When to Take a Break
- After completing a phase
- When consistently stuck (>3 days)
- Signs of burnout
- Major life events
- Just feeling overwhelmed

**It's OK to take breaks.** Better a 2-week break than quitting entirely.

## 💡 Growth Mindset

### Fixed vs Growth Mindset

**Fixed:** "I'm just not a math person"  
**Growth:** "I haven't learned this YET"

**Fixed:** "This is too hard"  
**Growth:** "This will take more time and practice"

**Fixed:** "I failed"  
**Growth:** "I learned what doesn't work"

### Dealing with Difficulty
- Math IS hard - that's normal
- Confusion means learning is happening
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Comparison is the thief of joy
- Your pace is YOUR pace

---
