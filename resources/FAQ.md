# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: Is this really free?
**A:** Yes! 100% free. All courses are from MIT OCW, Stanford, Harvard, and other free resources. Total cost: $0.

### Q: Do I need a math degree to start?
**A:** No. Prerequisites are just Calculus I, Statistics I, and high school algebra. If you're missing these, we provide links to free prep courses.

### Q: How long does this really take?
**A:** 13-14 months at 20-25 hours/week. Faster if you have more time, longer if you have less. We include realistic 20% buffer time.

### Q: Can I do this while working full-time?
**A:** Yes! Many learners do 15-20 hours/week with full-time jobs. It takes 16-18 months at that pace. Evenings + weekends work well.

### Q: Is this enough to get a job?
**A:** Yes, for entry-level quantitative roles. You'll be prepared for positions like:
- Junior Quantitative Analyst
- Data Scientist (with some additional ML practice)
- Operations Research Analyst
- Financial Analyst
- Risk Analyst

Senior positions typically require work experience.

## Curriculum Questions

### Q: Why 57 weeks instead of 2 years like other programs?
**A:** We cut:
- Pure theory not needed for applied work (Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra)
- Redundant material
- Overly specialized topics (Complex Analysis)
- Extensive review of prerequisites

We kept ONLY essentials needed for quantitative careers.

### Q: Why no Complex Analysis?
**A:** While beautiful, it's rarely used in:
- Finance (except exotic derivatives)
- ML/AI
- Operations Research
- Most computational economics

If you need it later (rare), you can add it. Most careers don't require it.

### Q: Can I skip sections I already know?
**A:** Yes! The curriculum is modular. If you have Linear Algebra, skip to Optimization. Just ensure you truly understand the material (>80% on problem sets).

### Q: What if a section is too hard?
**A:** 
1. Slow down - take 2x the suggested time
2. Add supplementary resources (Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown)
3. Ask for help in OSSU Discord or r/learnmath
4. Review prerequisites
5. Don't give up! Math takes time to sink in.

### Q: What if a section is too easy?
**A:** Speed up! If you're getting >90% on problem sets easily, move faster. Some sections might take you 4 weeks instead of 8.

## Career & Applications

### Q: Which career path is this best for?
**A:** ALL of them! That's the point. This curriculum equally prepares you for:
- Finance / Quantitative roles
- ML / Data Science
- Operations Research
- Computational Economics
- Risk Analysis / Actuarial

You choose your specialization through the capstone project.

### Q: Do I need a degree to get hired?
**A:** It depends:
- **With a Bachelor's degree (any field):** This curriculum + projects = qualified for entry roles
- **Without a degree:** Harder, but possible with exceptional projects + portfolio
- **For top firms (Goldman, Citadel, etc):** Usually require Bachelor's minimum

### Q: What about grad school?
**A:** This curriculum prepares you for MS programs in:
- Financial Engineering
- Operations Research
- Data Science
- Applied Mathematics
- Statistics / Econometrics

For PhD programs, you'd need to add: Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, and research experience.

### Q: Should I do this or get a Master's degree?
**A:** Consider:
- **This curriculum:** $0, 13-14 months, self-paced, immediate job entry
- **Master's degree:** $30k-$100k, 1.5-2 years, structured, better for top firms

If you have work experience + Bachelor's → This curriculum often better ROI.  
If you're young + can afford it → Master's degree opens more doors.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What if I don't have Calculus I or Statistics I?
**A:** Add 2-4 months:
- **Calc I:** 3Blue1Brown + Khan Academy (2 months, 10 hrs/week)
- **Stats I:** Khan Academy Statistics (2 months, 10 hrs/week)

Links provided in Prerequisites section.

### Q: What programming language is used?
**A:** Python. It's used in:
- Scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy)
- Data science (pandas)
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)
- Visualization (Matplotlib)

If you don't know Python, add 1-2 weeks to Phase 0 for basics.

### Q: Do I need a powerful computer?
**A:** No. Any laptop from the last 5 years works. Requirements:
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 20GB free storage
- Any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Cloud computing (Google Colab) is free for heavier tasks.

### Q: What if a link breaks?
**A:** Open an issue! We verify links regularly, but courses move. We'll update promptly.

## Study Strategy

### Q: Should I take notes?
**A:** Yes! Methods that work:
- Handwritten notes (better retention)
- LaTeX notes (good practice)
- Jupyter notebooks (for code + math)

Review notes before each phase transition.

### Q: How many problem sets should I do?
**A:** Enough to get >80% correct consistently. Usually:
- Easy sections: 50% of assigned problems
- Medium sections: 75% of assigned problems
- Hard sections: 100% of assigned problems

Quality > quantity.

### Q: Should I watch lectures at 2x speed?
**A:** For review, yes. For new material, 1x-1.5x is better. Understanding > speed.

### Q: What if I fall behind schedule?
**A:** That's normal! Options:
1. **Continue at your pace** - finish in 18 months instead of 14
2. **Skip easier problem sets** - do fewer exercises in easy sections
3. **Combine phases** - study multiple topics simultaneously (not recommended for beginners)

The schedule is a guideline, not a rule.

### Q: Should I study multiple topics simultaneously?
**A:** Not recommended unless you have:
- Strong math background already
- 30+ hours/week available
- High tolerance for context switching

Sequential learning (one topic at a time) usually works better.

## Projects & Portfolio

### Q: Are the projects required?
**A:** Strongly recommended! They:
- Cement understanding
- Build your portfolio
- Give interview talking points
- Show practical application

At minimum, do capstone project + 3-4 others.

### Q: Should I put projects on GitHub?
**A:** YES! Employers look at GitHub. Benefits:
- Shows you can code
- Demonstrates understanding
- Version control practice
- Public portfolio

Make repos public with good README files.

### Q: What if my projects aren't perfect?
**A:** That's fine! Employers want to see:
- You tried something hard
- You can explain your approach
- You learned from mistakes
- Your code is reasonably clean

Perfect isn't required. Effort is.

## Community & Support

### Q: Is there a study group?
**A:** Check GitHub Discussions for:
- Study group formation
- Weekly meetups
- Peer support
- Accountability partners

Also try OSSU Discord #mathematics channel.

### Q: Can I get help when stuck?
**A:** Yes! Resources:
1. GitHub Discussions (this repo)
2. OSSU Discord
3. r/learnmath on Reddit
4. Math Stack Exchange
5. Course forums (MIT OCW, etc.)

Always try for 30 min first - struggle helps learning!

### Q: How do I give back?
**A:** Once you've completed sections:
- Answer questions in Discussions
- Report broken links
- Suggest improvements
- Share your experience
- Help newer learners

## Comparison to Other Programs

### Q: How does this compare to OSSU Computer Science?
**A:** Different goals:
- **OSSU CS:** Comprehensive CS education (2-4 years)
- **This:** Applied math for quantitative careers (13-14 months)

Use both if you want CS + Math foundation.

### Q: How does this compare to university math degree?
**A:** We focus on applied math only:
- **University:** Pure + Applied math, 4 years, $40k-$200k
- **This:** Applied math only, 13-14 months, $0

University is better for: Research, pure math, traditional career path.  
This is better for: Self-learners, career changers, practical applications.

### Q: How does this compare to bootcamps?
**A:** 
- **Bootcamps:** $10k-$20k, 3-6 months, job placement focus
- **This:** $0, 13-14 months, deeper fundamentals

Bootcamps are faster but more superficial. This builds stronger foundations.

## Motivation & Completion

### Q: How many people complete this?
**A:** Unknown - curriculum is new (v1.0 Dec 2025). Self-study completion rates are typically 5-10%. You can beat the odds with:
- Consistency (show up every week)
- Accountability (study partners)
- Clear goals (know why you're doing this)
- Breaks (don't burn out)

### Q: What if I want to quit?
**A:** Common at weeks 8-12 and 25-30 (the "valleys"). Before quitting:
1. Take a 1-week break
2. Review your "why"
3. Find a study partner
4. Adjust pace (slower is OK)
5. Skip to easier material temporarily

Most who quit regret it later.

### Q: How do I stay motivated?
**A:** 
- Track progress visibly (use progress tracker)
- Celebrate small wins (completed phases)
- Connect with others (study groups)
- Remember your goal (career change, grad school, etc.)
- Take regular breaks
- Vary your study location

Discipline > motivation. Build systems, not willpower.
